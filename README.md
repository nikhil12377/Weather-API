## Reflection

I wanted to build an application that allowed users to pull data from the Weather API based on what they were interested in, such as 'Temperature in delhi'. I started this process by using the `create-react-app`, then adding `Bootstrap` and `redux`. One of the main challenges I ran into was implementing dark mode.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, Redux, Bootstrap and a significant amount of JSX, and CSS.
